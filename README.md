Great! 🚀 You've created a very basic **PHP project** with an `index.php` file that prints a message:

```php
<?php
echo "<h1>Hello from OpenShift!</h1>";
?>
```

This suggests you're likely preparing or have already deployed a **PHP app on OpenShift**. Here's how you can **complete and document this project properly**, especially on GitHub.

## ✅ Step-by-Step: Polish & Document Your OpenShift PHP Project

---

### 🗂 1. **Basic Directory Structure**

You likely have something like:

```
your-repo/
├── index.php
└── README.md   ← (You need to add this)
```

---

### 📝 2. **Create a README.md**

Let me help you write a basic `README.md` for your OpenShift PHP deployment:

---

### ✅ `README.md` Template:

```markdown
# PHP Hello World on OpenShift

This is a simple PHP application deployed on OpenShift. It consists of a single `index.php` file that displays a "Hello from OpenShift!" message.

## 🧠 Project Purpose

This project demonstrates how to deploy a minimal PHP application on an OpenShift environment using Source-to-Image (S2I) or PHP builder images.

## 📂 Project Structure

```

/
├── index.php         # Main entry point of the PHP application

````

## 🚀 Deployment Steps on OpenShift

### Using `oc` CLI:

```bash
oc new-project php-demo

oc new-app php:8.0~https://github.com/ketanpawar-kp/<your-repo>.git

oc expose svc/<your-service-name>
````

### Or via OpenShift Web Console:

1. Go to Developer → Add → Import from Git
2. Paste your GitHub repo URL
3. Select builder image: **PHP 8.x**
4. Click **Create**

## 🌐 Output

When deployed, the application shows:

```
Hello from OpenShift!
```
